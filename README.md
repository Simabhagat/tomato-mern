Getting the app running on your local server:
  1. CLone the repository using git clone
  2. cd frontend and run npm i
  3. in frontend, cd backend and run npm i again and then nodemon server
  4. cd .. and run "npm run dev". Now the project is working.

Improvements to be made:
1. Modify sign up api to create only unique users
2. add a different endpoint to make restraurant owners submit their items on server
3. payment integration with stripe
